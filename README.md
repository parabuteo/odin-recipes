# odin-recipes

My first actual project with The Odin Project

After having completed this project, I will have demonstrated
that I can implement the Git, GitHub, and HTML skills I have learned,
that I can find the answers elsewhere if I get stuck with anything,
and that I will have familiarized myself with good commit message habits.
